# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
One player command line tic-tac toe

I have been learning python for the past two weeks. I've been following a book called python crash course and using chat gpt to create practice problems for each topic. I've been trying to create one longer project each week. This is my first completed project. Feel free to give any suggestion about this project or my learning approach in general.
